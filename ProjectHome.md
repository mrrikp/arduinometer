This project is currently a work in progress and represents the output of my work to create an open-source Arduino-powered smart ethernet meter capable of monitoring your electricity, gas and water consumption.

Goals:
  * Low cost
  * Support pulse-count electricity, gas and water meters
  * Support opto-reflective gas meters
  * Generate data in EEML format (for direct publish to Pachube or consumption via some other service).

Note: following the release of my early stage prototype on my blog on 26th April, within the next few weeks I'll be aggregating your feedback with a view to releasing version 1.1 of the code and schematics. Once the initial round of feedback has completed I'll start making the downloads available here.
